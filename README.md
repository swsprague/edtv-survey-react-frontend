### Project Synopsis:
I wanted to create a survey system that allows users to submit responses to questions regarding programming choices and preferences as part the Plymouth Public Schools Educational Television Program. This project will be the first step in my approach to adding more functionality and dynamics to the EDTV website as part of my new role with EDTV, which I will be starting following the completion of this program!

### Planning:
I initially planned for this project to be a choose-your-own-adventure game, but after consulting with my brother I decided to use the idea in a more useful way (at least to me), where I'd be able to implement the application as part of my previously mentioned new role at EDTV. After plotting out my resources via an ERD and determining UI with wireframes, I set course for MVP and have been pushing toward it ever since.

### Catalog of Routes:

##### Survey:

|   CRUD Action | URI Pattern   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| GET      | /surveys |
| GET      | /surveys/:id     |
| POST      | /surveys    |
| PATCH     | /surveys/:id  |
| DELETE  | /surveys/:id   |

##### Question:

|   CRUD Action | URI Pattern   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| GET      | /questions |
| GET      | /questions/:id     |
| POST      | /questions    |
| PATCH     | /questions/:id  |
| DELETE  | /questions/:id   |

##### User Responses:

|   CRUD Action | URI Pattern   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| GET      | /responses |
| GET      | /responses/:id     |
| POST      | /responses    |
| PATCH     | /responses/:id  |
| DELETE  | /responses/:id   |

### Unsolved Problems:
- No branching Questions based on UserResponses
- Only a limited number of 'Answer' options can be added to a question
- Questions do not currently store their corresponding UserResponses
- UserResponses do not currently store their corresponding question ID
- Still need to implement proper logos and information related to EDTV Program to incorporate application into existing website
- Would like to eventually display survey results / percentages to users
